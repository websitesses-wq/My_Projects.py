# StoryLabs

Built StoryLab in Python — a simple text-based storytelling program with 5 different story types. The project uses only core Python concepts like input(), loops, and if-else conditions, with no imports and no functions.

This helped me strengthen my fundamentals, think through program flow, and focus on writing clear, readable logic while still building something fun and interactive.

This is my first project it might be small and simple but this is the beggning of a big project which is gonna be way more bigger and complex , for that this is the foundation of learning and implimenting python by making small projects and upgrading the code and project complexicty to develop and reach my final big project
